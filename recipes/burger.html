        <h3>The Veggie Paradise...</h3>
        <p>Say hello to the BEST veggie burger recipe! Of course, that’s just my opinion, but once you try it, I think you’ll agree. For one, these patties are grill-able! And if you’d rather be spending time in the sun than in the kitchen, you can even make them a day or two in advance.</p>
        <p>But that’s not all. This veggie burger has an amazing meaty texture and savory, smoky flavor. It’ll keep its shape when it’s stuffed inside a bun, and it’s delicious with fancy fixings or with good old ketchup and mustard. Unlike many packaged veggie burgers, its incredible texture and flavor come from simple, plant-based ingredients, so it doesn’t just taste good – it’s good for you, too!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients required:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tamari, balsamic vinegar, and mirin</strong> bring out the savory flavor of the mushrooms.</li>
            <li><strong>Smoked paprika and sriracha</strong> make these burgers smoky and spicy.</li>
            <li><strong>Finely chopped garlic and shallots</strong> add depth of flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Crushed walnuts</strong> give them a meaty bite.</li>
            <li><strong>Short grain brown rice, panko bread crumbs, and ground flaxseed</strong> help these burgers hold together. DON’T use long-grain brown rice here. It’s not as sticky as short grain rice, so it doesn’t yield cohesive patties.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps to follow:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot and sauté until soft, 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and a generous pinch of salt, and sauté until soft and browned, 6 to 9 minutes, turning down the heat slightly, as needed.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tamari, vinegar, and mirin. Stir, reduce the heat, then add the garlic, smoked paprika, and sriracha. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool slightly.</li>
            <li>In a food processor, combine the sautéed mushrooms, walnuts, flaxseed, brown rice, and ½ cup of the panko. Pulse until just combined. The mixture should hold together when pinched, but it should still have some texture.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a large bowl and fold in the remaining panko.</li>
            <li>Form into 8 patties, place them on a large plate and chill in the fridge for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>If you're grilling the patties, preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Brush the patties with olive oil and spray the grill with cooking spray. Place the patties on the grill and use a spatula to press down lightly. Grill for 7 minutes on the first side, flip, and grill for 6 to 7 minutes on the second side, or until well-charred and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Alternately, cook the patties on the stove. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Coat the bottom of the skillet with oil and cook the patties for 5 to 6 minutes per side, or until well-charred and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat, brush with Worcestershire sauce, and serve with desired fixings.</li>            
        </ol>
