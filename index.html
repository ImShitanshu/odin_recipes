        <p>You can get creative as you like with the toppings and make it just as you like!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients required:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>OO Flour</li>
            <li>Instant Yeast</li>
            <li>Warm Water</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Toppings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps to follow:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Prepare the dough.</strong> In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt together. Add the yeast to warm water and let it stand for a few minutes for bubbles or foam to appear.
                Pour yeasty water into the flour bowl slowly, mixing with a spoon at the same time. Once all the water has been added, add olive oil and mix with a spoon to combine.</p></li>

            <li><strong>Knead dough.</strong> Transfer the dough to a bench that’s been dusted with flour. Knead with your hands for about 10 minutes until the dough is elastic and smooth.</li>
       
            <li><p><strong>Resting time.</strong> Roll into a ball, tucking under the sides and allow to rest covered with a damp tea towel or plastic wrap for 30 -60 mintues.
                The dough would have doubled in size. Divide into 3 even balls then add a touch of olive oil to the top of the balls and let them rest covered with cling wrap or a damp cloth for a minimum of 2 hours.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Make the pizza.</strong> Peheat oven to its highest setting for 30 minutes with your pizza stone or oven tray inside. 
                To make the pizza shape, dust your bench with semolina flour and using your hands gently stretch into a pizza shape.</p></li>

            <li><strong>Add toppings.</strong> Add your tomato sauce and favourite toppings, all except the mozzarella cheese. Drizzle with olive oil and brush some onto the crust too.</li>

            <li><p><strong>Cook the Pizza.</strong> Gently move the pizza base to your heated pizza pan or oven tray. Cook in the oven on the lowest level for approximately 4-5 minutes.
                Remove from oven, add mozzarella cheese and place back in the oven for 3-4 minutes until the cheese has melted.</p> </li>
